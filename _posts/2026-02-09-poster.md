**You never know when you will come across something that can be interesting for your research.**

During my vacation in Chile (my country of origin), I came across this Argentinian poster while scrolling on Instagram. It says *“La obra es sobra del proceso”* (translated into English as: *The artwork is what remains of the process*). It is a bit difficult to translate because it is a wordplay with *obra* (artwork) and *sobra* (leftover), which only adds an “s” at the beginning.

This poster was published by one of my favorite stores in Argentina: [Quora](https://tiendaquorum.com/obras/IMR020). It is located in San Telmo, a beautiful and artistic neighborhood in Buenos Aires. I love this store because you can find many different kinds of artworks by Argentinian graphic artists.

The phrase is attributed to an artist called Sebastian –without accent– Gys. It is printed using a typographic press, which for me reinforces a political, vintage, pamphlet-like vibe. I could not find much more information about this artwork or about the artist.

For me, this phrase clearly summarizes what my project is about and reflects the idea that our ways of transmitting knowledge leave out many parts of the research process. What finally appears in a journal article is only a very small part of what research really is. In the same way, when an artist leaves a painting on the canvas, it is not only the final artwork, but also just one part of a much longer process that includes observations, experiences, layers of paint and erasures, reflections, and so on.
