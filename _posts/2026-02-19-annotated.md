**Is textual writing the only way to produce and deliver knowledge?**

I am currently taking a course on Interaction Design. Although I feel that I have learned a great deal about the foundations of design research, I am also realizing that these foundations are far more complex than they initially appear. Design produces artifacts; theory operates at an abstract level. How do we bring these two together?

As Löwgren (2013) writes:

>“The essence of research is to produce knowledge, and the essence of design is to produce artifacts.”

Coming from a background in sociology, I had rarely reflected deeply on research in design. My training has been centered on people and their interactions—perhaps because sociology naturally directs attention there. Design research, however, seems to operate differently. It asks how artifacts themselves can become knowledge.

In our last class, we discussed the idea of intermediate-level knowledge. The authors argued that one such form is the annotated portfolio (Löwgren, 2013). The concept was originally introduced by Gaver and Bowers (2012), who proposed annotated portfolios as a way of communicating design research. In this approach, knowledge is conveyed through a curated collection of artifacts accompanied by annotations.

What I find particularly compelling about this perspective is that these artifacts are not limited to traditional objects. They can include videos, postcards, installations, prototypes, and other forms of material expression. This expands what we understand as legitimate carriers of knowledge.

Löwgren (2013) extends this argument by positioning annotated portfolios as a form of intermediate-level knowledge—situated between particular artifacts and general theory. The annotations enable abstraction beyond the individual artifact, allowing insights to travel across contexts. In this sense, he also connects annotated portfolios to other intermediate forms of knowledge such as guidelines, criticism, patterns, and strong concepts. Therefore, he concludes that annotated portfolios constitute a legitimate mode of knowledge production.

All of this discussion is framed within a broader question: how can design enter the scientific community—particularly fields like Computer Science? How do we validate and establish rigor in knowledge that emerges through making?

In our group discussion, we found ourselves somewhat stuck on this issue. Many of us seemed skeptical of what felt like an over-scientification of design knowledge. One classmate even expressed discomfort with having to translate drawing into text.

This is where I want to pause.

Annotated portfolios are undoubtedly a valid form of knowledge production—but must the annotations always be textual? Are there situations in which knowledge can be produced and communicated without passing through textual analysis? Especially in the context I am working in, where dissemination of knowledge may occur through other media.

*Sometimes, as I write, I feel that what I am saying makes little sense. I hope that is simply part of the process.*

P.S. I am looking forward to reading:
