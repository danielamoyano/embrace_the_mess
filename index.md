# Embrace the Mess

A PhD journal in progress — notes, sketches, diagrams, and experiments on how knowledge travels.

---

### What this is
This is a working notebook.
I’m documenting ideas while they’re still forming: incomplete thoughts, visual models, failures, and small breakthroughs.

I’m researching new ways of transmitting knowledge — so the format is part of the experiment.

### How to read it
- **Journal entries**: day-to-day thinking and progress
- **Experiments**: attempts at visual/interactive transmission
- **Fragments**: raw notes worth keeping
